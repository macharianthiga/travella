# travella
A Full CRUD web application built with Node.js, Mongodb and Express


This application lets users view popular places upon login. Users can see images and descriptions of all destinations/campgrounds 
added by other users and leave comments. Users are also allowed to edit and delete campgrounds/ destinations they created.

I created this project with the aim of taking it to production but have since been tied up by other projects and have
been unable to continue working on it. Hopefully, I can get serious about it and proceed :-)

p.s: the ux/ui at signup and login is not the best.
